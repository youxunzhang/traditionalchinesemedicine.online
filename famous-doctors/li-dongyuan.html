            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Li Dongyuan, also known as Li Gao, practised during a time of war-induced famine and emotional strain. He observed that chronic fatigue, digestive weakness, and lingering dampness stemmed from depleted middle burner qi.</p>
            <p>His school emphasises nourishing earth, raising clear yang, and gently dispersing damp-heat so that the body can recover its own momentum.</p>
