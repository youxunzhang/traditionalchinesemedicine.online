            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Wang Shuhe served as an imperial physician and devoted himself to the rhythms felt beneath the fingertips. He carefully organised generations of pulse lore, relating qualities to organ systems and seasonal influences.</p>
            <p>Wang also safeguarded copies of Zhang Zhongjing’s texts at a time when war and fire threatened to erase them.</p>

                <li>Explained how climate, constitution, and disease alter pulse quality.</li>

            <h2>Legacy Note</h2>
            <p>Modern practitioners still reference Wang’s pulse categories when correlating tactile impressions with internal patterns. His work invites us to slow down and listen to what the blood is saying.</p>
