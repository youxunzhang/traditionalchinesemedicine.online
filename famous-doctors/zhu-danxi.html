            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Zhu Danxi, also known as Zhu Zhenheng, observed that the stresses of literati life—late nights, rich food, emotional intensity—tended to deplete yin and stir internal fire. He argued that most people had “yang in surplus and yin in deficiency.”</p>
            <p>His prescriptions therefore emphasise moistening, cooling, and directing the ministerial fire downward.</p>
