            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Zhang Zhongjing, courtesy name Jing, distilled centuries of medical learning into a cohesive clinical method. As epidemics ravaged the Eastern Han dynasty, he compiled insights from mentors and peers, seeking formulas that could be adapted as exterior conditions penetrated into the body.</p>
            <p>His approach blends observation, pulse diagnosis, and the dynamic tracking of cold-induced disorders. He is celebrated as the “Sage of Medicine” whose clarity still guides clinicians today.</p>

            <h2>Legacy Note</h2>
            <p>Zhang’s work reminds practitioners to look beyond symptoms toward the underlying momentum of illness. Each formula is a snapshot of how qi and fluids are moving, encouraging thoughtful adjustment rather than rote prescription.</p>
