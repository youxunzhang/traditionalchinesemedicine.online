            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Wu Jutong studied under Ye Tianshi’s disciples and continued to document epidemic diseases affecting the lower Yangzi region. His notes highlight how heat toxins can lodge in the membrane source, lingering even after fevers fade.</p>
            <p>He organised these insights into the <em>Wen Bing Tiao Bian</em>, a practical manual for clinicians facing rapidly changing symptoms.</p>
