            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hua Tuo studied widely and travelled light, serving both generals and common villagers. He perfected a herbal anaesthetic known as “mafeisan” and was famed for daring procedures, including the legendary scraping of poison from Guan Yu’s arm.</p>
            <p>When not treating wounds, he taught the Five Animal Frolics, a qigong sequence inspired by the movements of the tiger, deer, bear, ape, and crane.</p>
